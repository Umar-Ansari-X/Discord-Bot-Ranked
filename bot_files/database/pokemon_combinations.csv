Mega Mewtwo Y Y,Mega Mewtwo Y,Best move would be Future Sight. The one who has priority wins.,rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Regigigas,"Best move to use would be Future Sight. You lose, but you leave Regigigas at low HP, so you can cover up that damage with something that has a priority move in the back.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Kyogre,Best move to use would be Future Sight. You can 2KO the Kyogre.,rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Zacian,"Best move would be Future Sight. You can 2KO the Zacian if timid. You lose if you're a modest Mega Mewtwo Y. So if the opponent has something in the back like Eternatus, the best option would be to switch into something like Metagross to save Mega Mewtwo Y for it.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Rayquaza,"Best move would be Future Sight. It leaves Rayquaza at Extreme Speed range, so if you've got priority and an Arceus in the back, go straight! If not and you see an Eternatus in the back, switch out to save Mega Mewtwo Y if Eternatus counters your tail Pokémon.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Giratina,"Best move would be Future Sight. Recommended to switch on turn one to Pokémon like Yveltal or Rayquaza if you've got them, as Giratina OHKOs Mega Mewtwo Y.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Arceus,"Best move would be Future Sight. If you're careful, Mega Mewtwo Y stays in boldly because you'll win. If you're not careful and you doubt your opponent to be rash, switch to something like Giratina or Marshadow or Metagross.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Groudon,"Best move would be Future Sight. You die anyway to Groudon, but you can manage to catch his Precipice Blades or Eruption after Hammer on a Rayquaza or Yveltal. If you choose to go straight, have something in the mid like Arceus so it can kill the Groudon with the damage from Future Sight.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Zamazenta,"Best move would be Future Sight. It OKOs, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Eternatus,"Best move would be Future Sight. It OKOs, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Ho Oh,"Best move would be Future Sight. It 2KOs, so go straight in!",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Yveltal,"Best move would be Ancient Power. Yveltal is a Mega Mewtwo Y hard counter, so I prefer you switch into something like a Magearna or a bold Arceus in the back!",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Mega Metagross,"Best move would be Aura Sphere. Metagross is another hard counter of Mega Mewtwo Y, so you may switch to anything like Groudon, Kyogre, Yveltal, Rayquaza if you have those in the back.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Marshadow,"Best move would be Future Sight. It OKOs, so no worries. But Marshadow might get chip damage off Sucker Punch on Mega Mewtwo Y.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Flutter mane,"Best move would be Future Sight. Future Sight 2KOs, so no worries, stay right in!",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Magearna,"Best move would be Aura Sphere. But Magearna hard counters as Fleur Cannon debuffs Special Attack. So, you better switch into a Groudon/Metagross in the back.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Lunala,"Best move would be Future Sight. Lunala is a hard counter for Mega Mewtwo Y, so the best option would be to switch into a Yveltal/Rayquaza.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Slaking,"Best move would be Future Sight. Slaking kills Mega Mewtwo Y anyway, but you leave Slaking at low HP. A switch is not recommended, but if Mega Mewtwo Y has to be saved, yes, you gotta switch. Switch into a Metagross if you're doing so.",rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Koraidon,Best move would be Future Sight as it OKOs.,rahhla_coarster
Mega Mewtwo Y,Miraidon,Best move would be Future Sight as it has to 2KO as long as Mega Mewtwo Y is fast.,btc3476
Regigigas,Mega Mewtwo Y,"The best move would be Hammer + Giga Impact. You 2KO, so no worries.",btc3476
Regigigas,Regigigas,"The best move would be two Hammer Arm. If you have Superpower, use Hammer Arm + Superpower to debuff if the opponent switches. It's a priority game; if both are jolly, priority wins. One adamant and another jolly, jolly one wins.",btc3476
Regigigas,Kyogre,The best move to use would be hammer arm + giga impact. If you are jolly regi use two giga impact if u feel like opponent would switch into something like groudon. If you are ada regi and opponent is timid kyo use hammer arm + giga impact.,btc3476
Regigigas,Zacian,"The best move would be to use Hammer and Giga. Regigigas dies to Zacian anyway, unless it's a bad Zacian. After Hammer + Giga, Zacian is left at Extreme Speed range, so you can use a Rayquaza or Arceus mid while using Regigigas.",btc3476
Regigigas,Rayquaza,"The best move would be to use Ice Punch. If you feel like the opponent has an Impish Rayquaza, it's best to use Hammer Arm + Ice Punch. But if you don't have Ice Punch, you can use Hammer Arm + Giga Impact. It won't kill, but it will do good damage.",btc3476
Regigigas,Giratina,The best move would be to use Ice Punch thrice. It's better to switch up into a Yveltal if you have one in the back.,btc3476
Regigigas,Arceus,"The best move would be to use Hammer twice. Arceus dies to 2 Hammers, so go straight!",btc3476
Regigigas,Groudon,"The best move would be to use Hammer and Giga if your mint is jolly. If your mint is adamant, the best move is Giga Impact. It's best to run an Arceus or Ray along with Regigigas because they will cover up the damage.",btc3476
Regigigas,Zamazenta,"The best move would be to try to switch, as Zamazenta one-shots Regigigas mostly. If confident about tanking, play Hammer Arm + Giga Impact.",btc3476
Regigigas,Eternatus,"Best move would be to use Hammer Arm and Giga Impact + Giga Impact. You tank unless your Regigigas has unfavorable stats. In case of suboptimal stats, ensure you have a Pokémon in the back, like Arceus, Rayquaza, or Yveltal, capable of using a priority move or something faster than Eternatus.",btc3476
Regigigas,Ho Oh,"The best move would be to use two Giga Impact if you are jolly Regi. If you are adamant Regi, use Hammer + Giga Impact.",btc3476

Regigigas,Mega Metagross,"The best move would be to use Hammer if you think your opponent is adamant Metagross. If you feel like they are not, swap into a Pokémon like Groudon or Yveltal.",btc3476
Regigigas,Marshadow,"The best move would be to use Zen if you have it, or you can switch if you have a Giratina in the back.",btc3476
Regigigas,Flutter mane,"The best move would be to use Hammer and use Ice Punch/Fire Punch. If you have a Pokémon like Metagross in the back, it's recommended to do the 50/50 of Moonblast or Shadow Ball.",btc3476
Regigigas,Magearna,The best move would be to use Giga Impact twice or use Fire Punch twice if you have Fire Punch.,btc3476
Regigigas,Lunala,"The best move would be to use Knock Off. If you don't have Knock Off, it's recommended to switch onto a Yveltal or Rayquaza if you have one in the back.",btc3476
Regigigas,Slaking,"The best move would be to use Hammer and then Giga Impact. If you have priority, you win. If the opponent has priority, it's suggested to switch onto a Lunala/Giratina if you have them in the back.",btc3476
Regigigas,Koraidon,The best move would be to switch because Regi won't tank. Switch onto a Ghost type like Lunala/Giratina.,btc3476
Regigigas,Miraidon,"The best move would be to use Hammer and Giga Impact. It kills, so you're good!",btc3476
Kyogre,Mega Mewtwo Y,"The best move to use is Water Spout. Sadly, Water Spout doesn't OHKO, so prefer switching into a Yveltal if you have one. If you have an Arceus or Rayquaza mid, you can cover up the loss of Kyogre, as Water Spout + Extreme Speed kills Mega Mewtwo Y.",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Regigigas,"Best move to use is Water Spout. Water Spout doesn't OHKO, so you can choose to either switch into a Giratina if you have one in the back or Marshadow. Alternatively, you can choose to stay in and cover up the damage with a Pokémon with a priority move in the mid.",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Kyogre,"Best move to use is Water Spout + double edge. It's basically a mint game; the faster one wins. If both are Speed mints, the one who has priority wins.",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Zacian,Best move to use is Water Spout. You can choose to switch to a Metagross or Groudon in the back or choose to stay in and cover up the damage with an Arceus or Rayquaza with Extreme Speed in the middle.,rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Rayquaza,"Best move to use is Ice Beam. It OHKOs, so all good.",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Giratina,"Best move to use is Ice Beam. Giratina might tank depending on mints. If timid Kyogre, it tanks; if modest sassy Giratina, it tanks. So, if you don't want to risk and have a Pokémon needing Kyogre for in the back, it's best if you switch into a Yveltal if you face a Giratina.",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Arceus,"The best move to use is two Water Spout. Kyogre tanks Arceus, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Groudon,"The best move to use is Water Spout. It's a game on who's faster; Groudon dies anyway, but mints make the decision on whether Kyogre takes damage before dying or not. If timid Kyogre and has priority, Kyogre always wins.",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Zamazenta,Best move to use is Water Spout. You can choose to cover up the damage with an Arceus or Rayquaza mid or switch if you have a Ghost type in the back like Giratina.,rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Eternatus,"The best move to use is two Ice Beam. Eternatus gets 2KOed, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster

Kyogre,Flutter mane,"The best move to use is Water Spout. It 2KOs, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster

Kyogre,Lunala,"The best move to use is Water Spout. It 2KOs, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Slaking,"The best move to use is Water Spout. It OHKOs unless it's a 31/31 Slaking. It tanks if it's a 31 HP 31 SpDef Slaking, and hence Slaking wins. You can cover up the damage with an Arceus/Ray middle.",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Koraidon,"The best move to use is Ice Beam. Koraidon tanks and 2KOs, so if you have something like Lunala, it's best to switch on turn 1.",rahhla_coarster
Kyogre,Miraidon,"The best move to use is Ice Beam. Miraidon kills Kyogre anyway, so make sure to have something to cover up the damage, or you can switch in a Groudon on the opposing Thunder of Miraidon.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Mega Mewtwo Y,"The best move to use is Crunch if you have it or Giga Impact. It's recommended to switch into a Yveltal in the back, and Mega Mewtwo Y outspeeds Zacian. You can only win if you're timid/jolly and the opponent is modest/bold.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Regigigas,"The best move to use is two Close Combat. It tanks Hammer + Giga, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Kyogre,"The best move to use is Close Combat + Giga Impact. Bold Kyogre can tank it, but it kills others, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Zacian,"Best move to use is Close Combat + Giga + Giga. Faster Zacian wins. If both are the same speed and have a Speed mint, priority wins.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Rayquaza,"The best move is to use two Moonblast if you're modest; otherwise, use Close Combat + Moonblast.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Giratina,"The best move is to switch into a Pokémon like Yveltal because Giratina tanks 3 Moonblasts and would kill Zacian. But if you choose to stay in and cover up the damage with the middle Pokémon, use triple Moonblast if you survive to the third turn.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Arceus,"The best move is two Close Combat. You tank if it's a good Zacian, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Groudon,"The best move to use is Close Combat. It's preferred to switch into a Pokémon like Rayquaza if you have it, as Zacian gets 2KOed by Groudon and can't deal more damage. Alternatively, you can decide to cover up the damage with a Rayquaza/Arcanine in the middle.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Zamazenta,"Best move to use is Close Combat + Moonblast. Zacian wins no matter what, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Eternatus,"The best move to use is Close Combat + Giga Impact. You can choose to switch into a Kyogre if you have it in the back, or you can decide to cover up damage with an Extreme Speed from Ray/Arcanine.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Ho Oh,"The best move to use is Close Combat + Giga Impact. It leaves Ho Oh at low HP, so you can cover up the damage with a Rayquaza or Arcanine or any Pokémon that is faster than Ho Oh. Alternatively, you can choose to switch into a Pokémon like Rayquaza if you want to save Zacian.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Yveltal,"The best move to use is Close Combat + Moonblast. Yveltal tanks unless it's a modest Zacian, so make sure you have a Pokémon like Arceus/Rayquaza to cover up the damage.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Mega Metagross,"The best move to use is Close Combat. It's suggested to switch into a Groudon or Kyogre or Yveltal if you have one, as Metagross only takes 1 Close Combat and kills Zacian. You can also choose to stay in and cover up the damage with a Rayquaza/Speed mint Arceus/Yveltal so you can stay in without taking much damage on the middle Pokémon.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Marshadow,"The best move to use is two Moonblast. It kills, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Flutter mane,"The best move to use is Moonblast. It's recommended to switch as Flutter hard counters Zacian as long as Zacian doesn't have Iron Head in the moveset. Switch into a Pokémon like Kyogre. Alternatively, you can cover up the damage by using two Moonblast or Close Combat + Moonblast and have a Pokémon like Yveltal in the mid to use Sucker Punch and kill the Flutter.",rahhla_coarster
Zacian,Magearna,"The best move to use is two Close Combat. It leaves Magnezone at low HP, as Magnezone isn't fast; any Pokémon will do the deed. You can also switch onto a Metagross if you have one and feel like you need to save Zacian for another Pokémon in the matchup.",rahhla_coarster

Zacian,Miraidon,"The best move to use would be Moonblast + Close Combat + Giga Impact. If you outspeed opponent Miraidon, you win. If you think you would get outsped, the best move would be Close Combat + Giga. Or you can just catch a Thunder/Overheat on a Groudon in the back.",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Mega Mewtwo Y,"The best move would be Outrage + Extreme Speed. It kills, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Regigigas,"The optimal move is Ice Punch. If you suspect that Rayquaza might be impish, you have the option to use Hammer Arm followed by Ice Punch. Alternatively, you can choose Ice Punch directly if you believe Regigigas won't withstand it, then mitigate any damage with an Arceus/Rayquaza in the middle.",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Kyogre,"The best move would be Outrage. It leaves Kyogre at 50-60 HP, so you can have something in the back faster than Kyogre to cover up damage. Or if you feel like you need to save Rayquaza, you can just switch into a Pokémon like Arceus/Yveltal to do some chip damage so that Outrage can OHKO.",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Zacian,"The best move to use would be Hurricane + Extreme Speed. You can tank Timid Zacian with careful mint and 26+ SpDef and 27+ HP. You lose no matter what to Modest Zacian. You tank Jolly and Adamant Zacian with good stats. If you tank, use two Hurricane; if you don't tank, use Hurricane + Extreme Speed.

Rayquaza,Giratina,"The best move to use is Outrage. Outrage 2KOs, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Arceus,"The best move to use is Outrage. If Modest Arceus and you are Jolly and a good Rayquaza, two Outrage kills. If you are Adamant, the best move is Outrage + Extreme Speed. If you are Jolly and the opponent is Rash Arceus, you lose. If both are Speed mint, you lose. You can manage to cover up the damage by using an Arceus mid with priority. If non-priority, recommended to switch into a Lunala if you have one or a Metagross.",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Groudon,"The best move is Hurricane. Hurricane 2KOs, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Zamazenta,"The best move is Hurricane. It 2KOs, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster

Rayquaza,Marshadow,"The best move is Hurricane. It kills, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Flutter mane,"The best move is Fly. If you don't have Fly, it's suggested to switch onto any other Pokémon like Kyogre.",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Magearna,The best move is Hurricane. Suggested to switch into Groudon/Kyogre/Metagross because Magearna OHKOs and Hurricane does like 80 damage only.,rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Lunala,"The best move to use is Crunch. It OHKOs, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Slaking,"The best move to use is Outrage! It 2KOs, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Koraidon,"The best move to use is Extreme Speed. Suggested to switch into something like a Magearna if you have one or like a Metagross. It's a 50/50 if the opponent will do Close Combat or Outrage, so you have to risk it or let Ray die. Koraidon outspeeds almost everything, so it's best to do the 50/50 than to stay in.",rahhla_coarster
Rayquaza,Miraidon,"The best move to use is Outrage. It kills, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Giratina,Mega Mewtwo Y,The best move would be to use Shadow Force; it kills. But use Shadow Sneak if Mega Mewtwo Y is already damaged.,btc3476

Arceus,Mega Mewtwo Y,"The optimal move to use is Hyper Beam + Extreme Speed. You win as long as Mega Mewtwo Y isn't careful/bold. Rash Arceus is tanked by extremely good Mega Mewtwo Ys and by careful/bold Mega Mewtwo Ys. Mega Mewtwo Y tanks Timid and Naive Arceus. So if you need Arceus for something in the back, the best option is to switch into a Yveltal if you have one.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Regigigas,"The best move is to use Hyper Beam + Extreme Speed. You always lose to decent Regigigas. So if you have a Giratina in the back, it's best to switch into it if you have to save Arceus for the rest of the matchup. Or you can cover up the damage with a Pokémon with a priority move as Regigigas will be left with very low HP.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Kyogre,"The best move to use is two Hyper Beam. Kyogre tanks Arc and kills Arc. So, if you want to save Arc with full HP, switch to a Pokémon like Yveltal/Zacian/Zamazenta/Regigigas if you want to kill Kyogre without taking damage. Or you can cover up the damage by using something faster than Kyogre or something with a priority move like Arceus/Rayquaza/Yveltal in the middle.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Zacian,"The best move to use is Hyper Beam + Extreme Speed. Good Zacians always tank and 2KOs Arceus, so make sure to have something in the middle that can kill the low HP Zacian after it takes Hyper and Extreme from Arceus. You can also choose to switch into a Metagross/Groudon in the back if you want to save Arceus.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Rayquaza,"The best move to use is two Hyper Beam if you are speed mint. If you are not speed mint and the opponent is speed mint, you use Hyper + Extreme. If Modest, some extremely good Rays tank; others won't. If Rash Arceus, Rayquaza can't tank. If both speed mint, Arceus wins by 2 Hyper.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Giratina,The best move to use is Future Sight. Rash Arceus always dies to Giratina. Modest Arceus kills non-Sassy Giratina. Arceus always loses to Sassy Giratina no matter mints. Switching to Yveltal is the best option if you come across Giratina and want to save Arceus for any other Pokémon.,rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Arceus,"The best move is Hyper Beam. If you are modest mint and have 30 HP, 29 SpDef, or more, you can tank opposing Timid/Naive Arceus. If both are modest, Arceus priority wins.

Arceus,Groudon,"The best move is Hyper Beam + Extreme Speed. If you are Rash with good SpAtk and Atk and the opponent isn't calm/careful/bold, you win. If you are modest, you kill Groudon unless it's 29+ HP, 28+ SpDef, and 28+ stats. If you want to save Arceus, switch into a Rayquaza.",rahhla_coarster

Arceus,Yveltal,"The best move is two Hyper Beam. It kills, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Mega Metagross,"The best move is Earth Power. Arceus dies to Metagross unless Metagross is Jolly and Arceus is Bold. So the best option would be to switch into something like Giratina/Lunala/Yveltal/Rayquaza/Groudon if you have them, and then the moves of that + Earth Power kills Metagross. Or you can choose to cover up that damage by having a Yveltal/Speed Mint Rayquaza in the middle.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Marshadow,"The best move is Future Sight. Marshadow 2KOs Arceus, so it's suggested to switch into something like Giratina to keep Arceus alive. Or cover up the damage with a Yveltal in the back.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Flutter mane,"The best move is Future Sight. Flutter Mane defeats Arceus regardless, making it challenging to switch into any move. Cover up the damage by having Yveltal in the back, as Earth Power + Earth Power + Earth Power + Sucker Punch secures the knockout against Flutter Mane.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Magearna,The best move would be triple Earth Power. Magearna tanks as long as you don't get a drop. It is recommended to switch into a Metagross/Groudon to save Arceus for other Pokémon.,rahhla_coarster

Arceus,Koraidon,"The best move would be Future Sight + Extreme Speed. Koraidon tanks every Arceus except Rash Arceus, but Koraidon can tank Rash Arceus with good stats like 25+ HP, Def, and SpDef. So it is recommended to switch into something like Lunala if you have one, or you can stay in and cover up the damage with a Rayquaza/Metagross in the middle, as Koraidon has around 40-50 HP after Future + Extreme.",rahhla_coarster
Arceus,Miraidon,The best move would be Triple Extreme Speed. You lose if the opponent is Modest Miraidon. You can win if you are 25+ Atk Rash Arceus and the opponent is Timid Miraidon.,rahhla_coarster

Flutter mane,Giratina,"Best move is Moonblast for maximum damage, as Giratina wins by Shadow Force tap.",shield311
Flutter mane,Arceus,"Best move is Moonblast spam, wins by 3 shots. You can also use Mystical Fire as an alternative, but it will increase the moves to kill Arceus, but it's risky for switch-ins.",shield311
Flutter mane,Groudon,"The best move depends on your and your opponent's roster. You can either use Mystical Fire if you need lesser Eruption damage, like on your Yveltal or Zacian, or you can use Shadow Ball for maximum damage on Groudon as it loses by 1 shot via Precipice.",shield311
Flutter mane,Zamazenta,"Best move is Moonblast, but Iron Head users will outspeed and win by 1 tap.",shield311
Flutter mane,Eternatus,Best move is Mystical Fire and Psyshock spam; it wins against Eternatus. Though you can spam Mystical 1-2 times and use Moonblast to predict switches like Yveltals.,shield311
Flutter mane,Ho Oh,"Best move is Shadow Ball for maximum damage, as Ho Oh wins via Sky Tap.",shield311
Flutter mane,Yveltal,"Best move is Moonblast, as Yveltal wins via Sky Tap. Moon is best for overall switchouts too; it does most damage to most pokes that kill Flutter Mane, except Metagross, for which Shadow Ball is needed.",shield311
Flutter mane,Mega Metagross,"Best move is Shadow Ball, as Metagross wins via Meteor Mash tap. You can also use Mystical Fire, dealing 140-150 damage if you think the opponent can switch to a Pokemon immune to Ghost types.",shield311
Flutter mane,Marshadow,"Best move is Moonblast, as it wins as it's faster and taps. Marshadow can do Sucker Punch/Shadow Sneak, doing 110/160 damage respectively.",shield311
Flutter mane,Flutter mane,"Best move is Shadow Ball; priority/faster wins, as Shadow Ball deals 200 damage to Flutter Mane, and that's almost 85% of its HP. Therefore, the faster Flutter Mane, aka the player with priority, would be the winner in a Flutter Mane vs. Flutter Mane.",shield311
Flutter mane,Magearna,"Best move is Mystical Fire, as Magearna wins by Iron Head tap/Fleur + Iron tap in case of bad attack on Magearna.",shield311
Flutter mane,Lunala,"Best move is Shadow Ball, as it wins by 1 tap. Lunala is 4x weaker to Ghost-type moves, and Flutter Mane does approximately 490, 80 more than its max HP.",shield311
Flutter mane,Slaking,"Best move is Moonblast, as Slaking wins by two Sucker. You can Moonblast and switch out or switch out move one if you want to save your Flutter at max HP and switch in a Pokemon that kills Slaking.",shield311
Flutter mane,Koraidon,"Best move is Moonblast, as Flutter wins by 1 tap.",shield311
Flutter mane,Miraidon,"Best move is Moonblast, but it's priority-dependent; faster Pokemon wins. If Miraidon outspeeds, it will win via Overheat spam/Overheat + Thunder, which easily kills Flutter Mane, but in priority, Flutter Mane wins via Moonblast spam.",shield311

Magearna,Kyogre,"The best move is Fleur Cannon, but it's better to switch to Metagross and use Hammer Arm to outspeed Kyogre.",btc3476
Magearna,Zacian,"The best move would be to do Flash Cannon + Fleur Cannon, but you can also opt for 2x Fleur Cannon to avoid switches; it kills. You can also switch to Metagross to avoid getting Magearna damaged.",btc3476
Magearna,Rayquaza,"The best move to do will be Fleur Cannon; just keep it and don't switch, as it kills in one hit.",btc3476
Magearna,Giratina,"The best move to do will be 2x Fleur Cannon; better not to switch and keep Magearna, as it kills in two hits.",btc3476
Magearna,Arceus,"The best move to do will be 2x Fleur Cannon. It kills Rash Arceus, and 3x Fleur Cannon is needed to kill Modest/Timid, so it's better to keep using it.",btc3476
Magearna,Groudon,"The best move to do will be Fleur Cannon, but as Groudon one-shots, it's better to switch to Rayquaza.",btc3476
Magearna,Zamazenta,"The best move to do will be Fleur Cannon, but Zamazenta may 2-shot you. If you want to avoid that, switch to Rayquaza.",btc3476
Magearna,Eternatus,"The best move to do is Fleur Cannon 2x against Eternatus. It kills if you're modest; otherwise, you need 3x Fleur Cannon to kill Eternatus.",btc3476

Magearna,Flutter mane,"The best move to do is Fleur Cannon spam, but if you want, you can switch to Groudon.",btc3476
Magearna,Magearna,"The best move to do is Fleur Cannon once and then start doing Iron Head spam till you kill. However, if you want, you can switch to Metagross or Groudon.",btc3476

Magearna,Koraidon,"The best move to do will be Fleur Cannon; it one-shots, so keep it against Koraidon and don't switch.",btc3476
Magearna,Miraidon,"The best move to do will be Fleur Cannon 2x; it kills. However, if you want to save your Magearna for another Pokémon, you can switch to Groudon.",btc3476
Lunala,Mega Mewtwo Y,"The best move would be Moongeist Beam. It OHKOs, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Regigigas,"The best move would be Dream Eater + Dream Eater + Dream Eater. If your opponent uses Knock Off on turn 1, then it's better to switch into something like Metagross in the back if you have it, but only if Lunala is needed for something in the matchup. If Lunala isn't needed, you can let Lunala die and cover up the damage with a faster Pokémon like Arceus/Zacian/Zamazenta in the middle.",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Kyogre,"The best move would be to use Phantom Force twice. Have something in the middle to cover up the damage, like a faster Pokémon, or you can switch into a Rayquaza if you have one and save Lunala for the rest of the matchup.",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Zacian,"The best move would be Dream Eater + Dream Eater + Dream Eater. If you see that the opposing Zacian has Crunch, it's recommended to switch into a Pokémon that hard-counters Zacian, like Metagross/Giratina/Groudon. If there's no Crunch, stay in and kill Zacian!",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Rayquaza,"The best move would be Moonblast. You won't get a chance to Moonblast, as Crunch kills before it attacks, so it's recommended to switch into a Pokémon like Magearna if you have one.",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Giratina,"The best move would be Moongeist Beam. Giratina OHKOs Lunala, so you should have something in the middle like Yveltal to cover up the damage. Or you can just switch Yveltal in, do the deed, and save Lunala if it's needed for something else in the rest of the matchup.",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Arceus,"The best move would be Dream Eater + Dream Eater + Dream Eater. You win as long as Arceus doesn't get 2 Earth Power drops.

Lunala,Zamazenta,"The best move would be Dream Eater. It kills, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Eternatus,"The best move would be Dream Eater + Dream Eater. It kills, so no worries! Make sure you have decent defense, which is enough to tank a Crunch.",rahhla_coarster

Lunala,Yveltal,"The best move would be to switch, as Lunala dies before attacking. Switch into a Pokémon like Magearna.",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Mega Metagross,"The best move would be Moongeist Beam. It OHKOs; it 2KOs if Metagross is careful, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster

Lunala,Flutter mane,"The best move is to switch, as Flutter Mane OHKOs without taking damage. You can switch in Ho Oh or Kyogre.",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Magearna,"The best move to use is Moongeist Beam + Phantom Force + Phantom Force. It kills, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Lunala,Lunala,"The best move would be Moongeist Beam. Faster Luna wins. If both are +Speed mint and max speed, priority wins.",rahhla_coarster

Lunala,Koraidon,"The best move to use is Moonblast. It OHKOs, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster

Slaking,Zacian,"The best move is Hammer Arm + Mega Kick. Make sure you have a Pokémon with a priority move like Arceus/Ray in the back to cover up the damage, or you can switch into Metagross/Groudon to kill Zacian.",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Rayquaza,The best move to use is Play Rough + Sucker Punch. You can choose to switch into a Mag or stay in and kill the Ray with Arceus/Koraidon/Miraidon or anything faster.,rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Giratina,"The best move to use is Play Rough. It 3KOs as long as your Slaking tanks 2 Aura Sphere, which it probably does. So go straight if you tank; if you don't, it's suggested to switch into a Yveltal/Koraidon/Rayquaza.",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Arceus,"The best move to use is two Hammer Arm. It kills, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Groudon,"The best move to use is Hammer Arm + Mega Kick.

Slaking,Zamazenta,"The best move to use is Hammer Arm + Play Rough. It leaves Zamazenta at low HP, so you can kill it with Rayquaza/Arceus, which is following the Slaking.",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Eternatus,"The best move is Hammer Arm + Mega Kick. It leaves Eternatus at low HP, so you can kill it with Extreme Speed from Arceus/Rayquaza.",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Ho Oh,"The best move is two Mega Kick, irrespective of mint. If perfect bulk, Slaking loses to 2KOs from Jolly Ho Oh if Slaking is non-Speed mint. The only exception is Impish Slaking.",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Yveltal,"The best move is two Play Rough. It kills if Slaking is Jolly, irrespective of Yveltal mint. If Slaking is non +Speed mint, Yveltal Sky Attack 2KOs unless Impish Slaking.",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Mega Metagross,The best move is Hammer Arm + Sucker Punch. Recommended to switch into a Groudon or Yveltal. You can also stay in and kill with a middle mon like Arceus/Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza/Yveltal by taking only Bullet Punch damage.,rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Marshadow,"The best move to use is Play Rough + Sucker Punch. It kills Marshadow, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Flutter mane,"The best move to use is Play Rough. Slaking tanks 2 Moonblast and Play Rough 2KOs, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Magearna,"The best move to use is Hammer Arm Spam. Slaking dies to 2 Fleur, so you can choose to switch in a Metagross/Groudon or stay in and cover up the damage, as Magearna is slow.",rahhla_coarster
Slaking,Lunala,"The best move to use is Sucker Punch. It OHKOs, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster

Slaking,Miraidon,"The best move to use is Hammer Arm + Play Rough. It kills, so no worries.",rahhla_coarster

Koraidon,Regigigas,"The best move to use is Close Combat. Jolly Regigigas can't tank Jolly Koraidon. Impish Regigigas tanks Jolly Koraidon, and Adamant Regigigas is an assured win.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Kyogre,"The best move to use is two Close Combat. It kills, so go straight!",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Zacian,"The best move to do is to switch in Metagross/Groudon because Koraidon gets OHKOd by Zacian. If Zacian is non-speed mint and Koraidon is speed mint, you can manage to get a Close Combat/Giga Impact. However, Zacian has high speed, so it won't help the middle Pokémon to kill without taking damage. It's best to switch into Metagross/Groudon.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Rayquaza,"The best move to do is Outrage. It kills, so go straight!",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Giratina,"The Best move to do is two Outrage. It kills, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster

Koraidon,Groudon,"The best move to do is Breaking Swipe + Close Combat. You can't tank Groudon, but it leaves it at low HP, and it's also debuffed, so any Pokémon faster than Groudon can cover up the damage. You can also switch into Rayquaza if you want Koraidon alive with full HP.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Zamazenta,"The best move to do is two Close Combat. If you are faster, you win. If Zamazenta is faster, Zamazenta wins.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Eternatus,"The best move to use is Outrage. Outrage leaves Eternatus at very low HP, and a Pokémon with a priority move or a Pokémon faster than Eternatus as the next Pokémon can cover up the damage.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Ho Oh,"The best move to use is Outrage. Ho Oh OKOs Koraidon, so if you want to switch, you can switch into a Pokémon like Miraidon or Timid Kyogre if you have priority.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Yveltal,"The best move to use is Breaking Swipe + Close Combat. It leaves Yveltal at low HP, so an Arceus/Rayquaza can kill it with a priority move. You can also switch into Miraidon if you want to keep Koraidon alive.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Mega Metagross,"The Best move to use is Close Combat. Koraidon dies to Metagross, so you can choose to save Koraidon or cover up damage with some Pokémon in the middle, as Metagross is debuffed. You can switch into Pokémon like Rayquaza/Groudon/Yveltal.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Marshadow,"The best move to use is two Close Combat. You win as long as you are speed-minted. If you are not speed-minted and Marshadow is speed-minted, Marshadow wins. But even if you aren't speed-minted, you can cover up the damage with a Sucker Punch from Yveltal as Marshadow is at low HP.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Flutter mane,The best move to use is Flare Blitz.,rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Magearna,"The best move to use is Close Combat. You can cover up the damage, as Magnezone is slow, with Kyogre/Groudon/Metagross/Arceus. If you want Koraidon alive, you can choose to switch into Metagross/Groudon.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Lunala,"The best move is Outrage. You get OHKOd by Lunala, so you can choose to switch into Rayquaza/Yveltal or cover up damage with Rayquaza/Yveltal/Marshadow in the middle.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Slaking,"The best move to use is two Close Combat. It kills, so no worries!",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Koraidon,"The best move to use is Outrage. Faster Koraidon wins. If both are speed-minted, priority wins.",rahhla_coarster
Koraidon,Miraidon,The best move is Outrage. Koraidon wins no matter what as it tanks Dragon Pulse. Priority decides whether Koraidon kills at full HP or with some HP left.,rahhla_coarster
Miraidon,Mega Mewtwo Y,"The best move is Overheat. Since Mega Mewtwo Y is faster, it's going to outspeed and kill Miraidon. But if Miraidon is faster due to mints, then Miraidon wins via Overheat and Thunder. If you are slower and need to save the low HP Miraidon, you can switch to other Pokemon to kill Mega Mewtwo Y off, as its special attack is already lowered. Timid Minted Mega Mewtwo Y wins by 2-tap.",shield311
Miraidon,Regigigas,"The best move is Thunder, but switching out is recommended as Regigigas will Hammer Arm, slowing it, and outspeeds and kills using Giga Impact. Switching to Pokemon like Marshadow or Metagross is recommended if you want to save Miraidon. Regigigas wins via 2-tap.",shield311
Miraidon,Kyogre,"The best move is dependent on the situation. If Miraidon is very low on HP, then Thunder is the way for most damage. But if it's above 200 and below 250, then Parabolic Charge and Thunder is the deal. However, you can also Overheat for rare occasions, though it isn't recommended. Miraidon wins via 2-tap.",shield311
Miraidon,Zacian,"The best move is Overheat. Zacian would usually outspeed and kill Miraidon, but if you are sure your opponent's Zacian is slower, then you can 2-tap by Thunder (Modest Mint) or switch out to Pokemon like Groudon and Metagross. Zacian wins via a lot of separate move combinations.",shield311
Miraidon,Rayquaza,"The best move is Dragon Pulse. It deals roughly 290/356 HP to Mega Ray, but you can switch out and chip Rayquaza using Pokemon like Marshadow, Rayquaza, Arceus, Metagross, and then land Dragon Pulse, or you can Pulse and then kill with the following. Rayquaza wins via Outrage 1-tap.",shield311
Miraidon,Giratina,"The best move is Dragon Pulse. It will win via a 2-tap as it outspeeds and kills Giratina, and Giratina does not 2-tap via Dragon Claw and Shadow Sneak. Miraidon wins via a two Dragon Pulse kill.",shield311
Miraidon,Arceus,"The best move is Overheat. Arceus and Miraidon are always a nearly stat and mint game. A very good attack Arceus will have to play a 5050 against Miraidon for move 1, Overheat, or Parabolic Charge, as a good attack Rash Arceus kills Miraidon by 3 Extreme Speed. So, you can either Parabolic Change and risk the opponent doing Hyper Beam or Overheat and Parabolic, gambling the stats/mint of your opponent. Nonetheless, if Extreme Speed fails to 3-tap it, then Miraidon wins via Overheat twice then Dragon Pulse kill, since most players run Hyper Beam.",shield311
Miraidon,Groudon,"The best move is Dragon Pulse. It deals the most damage to Groudon but cannot win against it. So, switching out is probably the best thing to do if you have Pokemon like Rayquaza in your team and you need to save Miraidon. Groudon wins by Precipice Tap.",shield311
Miraidon,Zamazenta,"The best move is Thunder, but Zamazenta wins via two Close Combat. So, it is better to switch out to Pokemon like Zacian, Groudon if you need to save Miraidon for other opponent Pokemon. Zamazenta Wins via two Close Combat.",shield311
Miraidon,Eternatus,"The best move is Overheat + Overheat + Dragon Pulse. Most Eternatus will die to Miraidon, but if some players decide to run Outrage instead of Hyper Beam, then Miraidon loses, as Dynamax Cannon after the first Overheat and Outrage will kill. 90% of the time, Miraidon wins via Overheat twice then Dragon Pulse kill, since most players run Hyper Beam.",shield311
Miraidon,Ho Oh,"The best move is Thunder + Parabolic Charge. Since Miraidon is faster, you can Thunder Ho Oh to deal a huge blow and then end with Parabolic Charge, which will kill Ho Oh and give you some heal in turn. Miraidon wins via Thunder + Parabolic or Thunder + Thunder or Thunder + Dragon Pulse.",shield311
Miraidon,Yveltal,"The best move is Parabolic Charge. It will 2-tap most non-Careful Yveltals, but in case it doesn't or your opponent did Snarl, you can Parabolic then Thunder. Miraidon wins via Parabolic spam/Parabolic + Thunder. The only case Miraidon loses to Yveltal is if the opponent runs Dragon Rush on Yveltal, which is rare.",shield311
Miraidon,Mega Metagross,"The best move is Overheat. Miraidon wins via overheat + Parabolic charge, which will deal a heavy blow and heal Miraidon slightly after the ordeal.",shield311
Miraidon,Marshadow,"The best move is Thunder, Miraidon wins against non-adamant Marshadow via Thunder spam or Thunder + Dragon Pulse, adamant good attack Marshadow can win against low HP Miraidon via close combat and sucker punch.",shield311
Miraidon,Flutter mane,"The best move is Overheat, priority/faster Pokemon wins, Overheat + Thunder or Overheat spam wins against Flutter Mane if faster Miraidon, otherwise Flutter Mane will win via moonblast spam.",shield311
Miraidon,Magearna,"The best move is Overheat, Miraidon wins via two Overheat on Magearna.",shield311
Miraidon,Lunala,"The best move is Overheat + Parabolic Charge + Thunder, Miraidon always wins against Lunala with these move combinations which also gives slight heal to Miraidon after ending Lunala.",shield311
Miraidon,Slaking,"The best move is Thunder, but switching out is recommended as Slaking wins via Hammer Arm and Mega Kick. You can either save Miraidon and kill Slaking with other Pokemon on your team or let Miraidon die and end with other pokes. Slaking Wins via Hammer Arm and Mega Kick/Play Rough.",shield311
Miraidon,Koraidon,"The best move is Dragon Pulse. You can either switch out and get Koraidon chipped or end it with other pokes, as it does 290/346 damage to Koraidon, and Koraidon always 1-taps Miraidon. Koraidon wins via 1 tap surviving D-pulse.",shield311
Miraidon,Miraidon,"The best move against Miraidon is Overheat and Dragon Pulse, though it's a bit tricky as some people can specifically run Outrage on Miraidon, like the Eternatus case, to kill other Miraidons. But usually, the faster poke wins. Overheat + Dpulse spam wins for faster Miraidon.",shield311
Golisopod,Golisopod,"The best move is Triple First Impression. Priority wins here. The non-priority person can choose to switch into a Dragonite/Primarina if they want to save Golisopod. But while switching to Primarina, the priority person does Razor Shell and gets Primarina down by getting one Moonblast only. If it's Dragonite, you got nothing to think; you can switch freely as the drop won't make Golisopod kill Dragonite.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Metagross,"The best move to use is Sucker Punch + Sucker Punch + First Impression. You win as long as Metagross isn't Rash. If you are 31 HP 31 SpDef, you tank Rash Metagross, so you win no matter what. If you feel like Golisopod will die, and you need Golisopod for the rest of the matchup, if there is something like a Mamoswine in the back, you can catch a Hyper Beam on a Dragapult.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Primarina,"The best move to use is Razor Shell + First Impression. If you get a drop, you leave Primarina at 80-90 HP. If you don't, you leave Primarina at 120 HP. If you want to save Golisopod for the rest of the matchup, you can switch into something like Metagross/Braviary (if he does Icy Wind, you're dead, so it's a 50-50) and do the move, then First Impression kill, as you get enough damage from Metagross/Braviary.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Garchomp,"The best move to use is Triple First Impression. If you are Adamant and sure the opponent is not Impish Garchomp, you can choose to try your luck on Razor Shell because if you get a drop, you only take the damage of 1 Dragon Rush. If you aren't Adamant Mint, you take 2 Dragon Rush damage no matter what. If you are Adamant and the opponent is Impish Garchomp, you still take 2 Dragon Rush. Impish Garchomp can kill Golisopod if Golisopod is switched into it. Adamant Golisopod can kill non-Impish Garchomp if Golisopod is switched in and it gets Razor drop; otherwise, it dies via Dragon Rush 3KO.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Dragapult,"The best move to use is two Sucker Punch. It kills, so go straight! Beware the opponent can switch into Primarina or Dragonite or Braviary if he has one, as no one will stay in with Dragapult against Golisopod. So, you can do the 5050 of Sucker Punch / Razor Shell and switch in something else if he's switching.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Dragonite,"The best move would be Razor Shell + Sucker Punch + First Impression. You lose no matter what, so it's suggested to switch in something like Metagross to do some damage and kill it off with Golisopod.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Braviary,"The best move would be Sucker Punch. Braviary OHKOs Golisopod without taking damage unless it's an Impish Golisopod with good stats. So if you are an Impish Golisopod and sure the opponent is not Ada Braviary, you can stay in and use Razor Shell, and if you get a drop, kill it if you have something faster than Braviary in the back. Or you can choose to switch into something like a Metagross to kill Braviary or take the 5050 to switch into a Rhyperior if you have one, whether he will do Superpower/Sky Attack. You can't kill by staying in unless you have priority and have something like a Mamoswine/Galarian Darmanitan in the back to kill with the damage from Sucker Punch.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Kommo-o,"The best move to use would be Mud Shot spam and kill it with something in the back, as anything like Dragonite/Dragapult/Garchomp/Primarina would be faster than Kommo-o as it is Mud-Shotted. If you want to save Golisopod, you can switch into something like a Primarina/Unfezant.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Grimmsnarl,"The best move to use would be two First Impression. It kills, so go straight! The opponent might switch in Primarina/Dragonite/Braviary if he has one, so it would be good if you did Razor Shell first turn in case they decide to switch.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Salamence,"The best move would be Razor Shell + Sucker Punch. You can't really switch in anything much because Salamence can either use Outrage or Fly, so you can't switch in anything like Primarina/Dragons. You can do the 5050 of switching in a Metagross, and he using Outrage, a Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch + Sucker Punch of Golisopod kills Salamence.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Arcanine,"The best move to use is Razor Shell. It kills, so no worries! If it doesn't kill, you can do a Sucker Punch / First Impression along with that.",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Sneasler,"The best move would be two Razor Shell. It kills, so no worries! Switching in any Pokemon in Razor Shell would be a blunder by the opponent, so you go straight!",rahhla_coarster
Golisopod,Kangaskhan,"The best move would be two First Impression. Golisopod wins no matter what, but the drop decides whether Golisopod takes damage before dying. Ada Golisopod doesn't kill Impish Kangaskhan via First Impression 2KO. You need a Razor drop to kill Impish Kangaskhan without taking 2 Last Resort. If you're non-Ada Golisopod, you need a Razor drop to win without taking 2 Last Resort damage.

Dragonite,Tyrantrum,"The best move would be Outrage. It OHKOs as long as the opponent isn't Impish Tyrantrum. No Tyrantrum can tank Adamant Dragonite, but Tyrantrum can outspeed any non-speed Mint Dragonite on Jolly Mint and OHKO via Head Smash without taking damage.

Dragonite,Ursaluna,"The best move would be double Outrage. Ursaluna tanks, and Play Rough 2KOs, but Ursaluna is slow and left with low HP so anything faster/anything with a prio move can do the deed.

Dragonite,Dondozo,"The best move would be Outrage spam. It kills after some turns, so no worries! There will be a Falinks in the back, and Dondozo would Noble Roar spam to debuff Dragonite. Falinks will spam No Retreat and get overpowered, so to prevent this, you can switch in a Primarina/Braviary on turn 1 to kill Falinks before it gets overpowered.",rahhla_coarster
Dragonite,Iron Treads,"The Best move would be Fire Punch. Iron Treads 2KOs, and Dragonite dies getting only a Fire Punch.

Dragonite,Sandy Shocks,"The best move would be Outrage + Extreme Speed. You can cover up the damage by a Pokemon faster than it or with a prio move like Aqua Jet/First Impression. Adamant Dragonite kills non-Bold Sandy Shocks via Outrage + Extreme Speed. Non-Ada Dragonite dies to Modest Sandy Shocks 2 Zap Cannon (if it hits only 50% chance) Careful Dragonite can tank 2 Zap Cannon from Timid Sandy Shocks. Or else if the opponent doesn't use Zap, you can use double Outrage.",rahhla_coarster
Dragonite,Iron Bundle,The best move would be to switch into a Primarina/Golisopod as Dragonite gets OHKOed without getting a chance to attack.,rahhla_coarster
Dragonite,Iron Valiant,"The best move would be Hurricane if you have it. If you don't, use Fire Punch + Extreme Speed. And kill it with something faster like Dragapult/Iron Bundle.

Rhyperior,Metagross,"The best move would be Rock Wrecker. If you are Jolly and the opponent isn't Jolly, you win. If both are Jolly Mint, Prio wins. If both are Adamant Mint, Prio wins. If you are Adamant and you don't have Prio, the best option would be to switch into something like a Primarina/Metagross (Hammer Arm to make it slower), then kill with Rock Wrecker. Or you can also switch in a Braviary to OHKO Golisopod.",
Rhyperior,Primarina,"The best move would be Earthquake. If your Pokemon in the middle is slower, use Bulldoze to lower its speed. If you want to save Rhyperior, you can switch in a Golisopod. But if he is Rash, you lose, so you can choose to stay in and kill the Metagross with something faster or a prio move like First Impression/Sucker Punch.",
Rhyperior,Garchomp,"The best move would be to switch in something like a Metagross and Hammer Arm it to make it slower, then Rhyperior kills it as long as it's Jolly. If you choose to go straight, you lose without taking damage.",
Rhyperior,Dragapult,"The best move would be Earthquake. If your middle Pokemon is faster than it, if it's not, use Bulldoze for speed control and kill it with the middle Pokemon. If you want to save Rhyperior, switch into something like a Togekiss (if you have) or Golisopod.",
Rhyperior,Dragonite,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It kills always if Adamant Mint Rhyperior and non-Impish Mint Dragapult. Dragapult tanks Adamant on Impish Mint. 31 HP 30 Defense Dragapult tanks max ATK Jolly Rhyperior. You never lose a 1v1 vs Dragapult.,
Rhyperior,Braviary,"The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It always kills irrespective of Mints, so no worries!",
Rhyperior,Kommo-o,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It kills so no worries! But Superpower will debuff the Rhyperior.,
Rhyperior,Grimmsnarl,"The best move would be Earthquake if your middle Pokemon is faster. If it's not and you want speed control, use Bulldoze. You can also switch in a Primarina if you feel like you need to save Rhyperior.",
Rhyperior,Salamence,The Best Move would be Rock Wrecker. It kills so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Arcanine,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It kills so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Sneasler,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It kills so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Kangaskhan,"The best move would be Earthquake. It kills so no worries! If you suspect the opponent is switching, you can use Bulldoze (it kills Sneasler and also debuffs opponent speed if it switches).",
Rhyperior,Feraligatr,"The Best move would be double Rock Wrecker. If you suspect the opponent is switching, you can use double Hammer Arm to debuff the opponent's speed if it switches. You kill it either way.",
Rhyperior,Mamoswine,"The best move would be to switch into a Braviary. If you don't have it, switch in something like a Metagross if you have it and double Hammer Arm to make it slower than Rhyperior and use Rock Wrecker to kill the Feraligatr.",
Rhyperior,Pyroar,"The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It leaves Mamoswine at low HP, and anything like a Dragonite/Metagross/Golisopod middle can cover up the damage.",
Rhyperior,Delphox,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It kills so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Haxorus,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It kills so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Spiritomb,"The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It leaves Haxorus at low HP so you can kill it with a Golisopod/Metagross mid or something faster than it. You OHKO Haxorus if Adamant Rhyperior. Impish Haxorus tanks Adamant Rhy and then 2KOs via Double Outrage. Haxorus always kills unless Adamant Rhy, and Impish Haxorus always wins irrespective of Rhy Mint.",
Rhyperior,Darmanitan,"The best move is to use Rock Wrecker. If the opponent is faster and he gets a Shadow Ball special defense drop, he wins. If he doesn't get the drop, you win. If you are Adamant Rhyperior, you OHKO Spiritomb always unless Impish Spiritomb. Spiritomb always tanks Rhyperior with good bulk. You can also switch in a Golisopod/Primarina if you want to save Rhyperior.",
Rhyperior,Falinks,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It OKOs so go straight!,
Rhyperior,Bewear,"The best move would be Earthquake. Falinks can No Retreat, after one No Retreat, Rhyperior gets OHKOed if Adamant Falinks. If Jolly Falinks, Rhyperior tanks and gets 2 Earthquake. If the opponent does 2 CC, you only get one Earthquake but will do some good damage. So you can cover up the damage with some faster Pokemon middle or something which resists fighting like Dragonite/Dragapult/Primarina.",
Rhyperior,Galarian Darmanitan,"The best move would be Earthquake if you want more damage. If you want speed control, like if your middle Pokemon is like Ursaluna/Primarina or something, use Hammer to outspeed the Bewear.",
Rhyperior,Drednaw,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It OKOs so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Staraptor,"The best move would be to switch into something like a Metagross, as Rhyperior gets OHKOed unless Impish Rhy and Jolly Drednaw. If you are Impish and the opponent is Jolly, you win via Earthquake OHKO (takes Liquidation damage though).",
Rhyperior,Sirfetch'd,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It kills so go straight!,
Rhyperior,Porygon-Z,"The best move would be to switch into something like a Dragonite/Spiritomb/Dragapult, as Sirfetch'd OHKOs always if Adamant Sirfetch'd. You tank Jolly Sirfetch'd on Impish Mint. If you are Impish and the opponent is Jolly, you can choose to stay in and cover up the damage with a Pokemon faster than Sirfetch'd in the back.",
Rhyperior,Archeops,The best move is Rock Wrecker. You win always if Adamant Rhyperior. You can win always if Jolly Rhyperior and the opponent isn't Bold Mint. You lose if you are non-Adamant Mint and the opponent is Bold.,
Rhyperior,Cryogonal,The best move is Rock Wrecker. It OKOs so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Tyrantrum,"The best move is to switch into something like Golisopod/Metagross, as Cryogonal OHKOs Rhyperior without having a chance to attack.",
Rhyperior,Rhyperior,The best move would be Earthquake. You always kill as Rhyperior tanks 2x Earthquake. You OHKO if Adamant Rhyperior and non-Impish Tyrantrum. You 2HKO if non-Adamant Mint Rhyperior.,
Rhyperior,Rillaboom,"The best move would be Bulldoze + Earthquake. If both are Speed Mint, Prio wins. If both are non-Speed Mint, Prio wins. If one non-Speed Mint and one Speed Mint, Speed Mint wins. Impish Rhyperior can tank Bulldoze + Earthquake from non-Ada Rhyperior.",
Rhyperior,Ursaluna,"The best move would be to switch into a Golisopod/Unfezant/Braviary if you have one, as Rhyperior gets OHKOed without having a chance to attack.",
Rhyperior,Tauros,"The best move would be Double Hammer Arm. If the opponent is Impish, and you aren't Adamant, the opponent wins. If the opponent is Adamant and you aren't Impish, the opponent wins. If both aren't Impish Mint, Rhyperior wins.",
Rhyperior,Baxcalibur,"The best move would be Hammer Arm + Rock Wrecker. It kills, so no worries!",
Rhyperior,Scream Tail,The best move would be Rock Wrecker. It OKOs so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Gholdengo,"The best move would be Rock Wrecker spam. It kills after some turns, so no worries! Opponent might have a Falinks in the back, so you can switch into a Primarina/Braviary/Unfezant on turn 1 if you want to win, as Falinks gets overpowered by No Retreat spam, and Rhy will be debuffed by Scream Tail Noble Roars.",
Rhyperior,Dondozo,The best move would be Earthquake. It kills so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Iron Treads,"The best move would be Rock Wrecker spam. Adamant Dondozo OHKOs Rhy. You tank Adamant Dondozo on Impish Mint. Or else you can face any non-Adamant Dondozo on any Mint except -Def. Opponent might have a Falinks in the back, so you can switch into a Primarina/Braviary/Unfezant on turn 1 if you want to win, as Falinks gets overpowered by No Retreat spam, and Rhy will be debuffed by Dondozo Noble Roars.",
Rhyperior,Iron Thorns,"The best move would be Earthquake. It leaves Iron Treads at low HP, so you can kill it with something with a Prio move like Primarina/Golisopod or something faster like Iron Valiant/Iron Bundle, etc.",
Rhyperior,Sandy Shocks,The best move would be Earthquake. It OKOs so no worries!,
Rhyperior,Iron Bundle,"The best move would be to switch into something like a Dragonite, as Rhyperior gets OHKOed without doing damage.",
Rhyperior,Iron Valiant,"The best move would be to switch into something like a Golisopod/Primarina, as Rhyperior gets OHKOed without doing damage.",
Rhyperior,Annihilape,"The best move would be Earthquake, if your middle Pokemon is faster, like Dragapult/Iron Bundle. If it's slower and you want speed control, use Bulldoze. You can also switch into a Gholdengo if you want to save Rhyperior with full HP for the rest of the matchup.",
Rhyperior,Iron Jugulis,"The best move would be Earthquake. You can cover up the damage with some Pokemon faster than Annihilape mid. If your mid Pokemon is slow and you need speed control, you can use Bulldoze.",
